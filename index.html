				<p  align="justify">Software engineering is vital for IoT systems to design systems that are secure, interoperable, modifiable, and scalable. However, industry and academia are still working on many crucial questions related to software engineering for IoT systems. For example, regarding the best practices for developing IoT systems, how to select the hardware, communication, and software architectures of IoT systems, which communications protocols are the most suitable for a system, and how to guarantee security and privacy when dealing with consumer products often composing IoT systems. </p>

				<p  align="justify">The Special Issue (SI) on Software Engineering Research and Practices for the Internet of Things aims at creating awareness in the research and development communities and provide a forum for researchers to provide observations, concepts, approaches, frameworks, and practices that promote the role of software engineering and software-engineering solutions in IoT multidiscipline development environments.</p>
